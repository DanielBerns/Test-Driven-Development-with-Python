# Test-Driven-Development with Python step by step code-along
https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/

## Part 1: The fundamental workflow of TDD and a gentle introduction to Django 
Setup according to instructions went really smoothly, which was really nice. 
The instructions were also clear, so very easy to code along. _Quite soon I got 
into the habit to first try to think about what the next step should be after 
finishing a piece of code, or after updating a test and getting a new failure._ 
This practice helped keeping me more engaged.

I really appreciate how unit testing and functional testing are handled in 
parallel, as that keeps the focus both on the low level internal consistency, 
but also tying back to the user story level to ensure the code actually is 
achieving something of use.

## Part 2: Real Developers Ship

**8. Prettification: Layout and Styling, and What to Test About It**
Quick intro to bootstrap and django templating.

**9. Testing Deployment Using a Staging Site**
Pushing you to setup the site on an actual server and get a proper domain. 
Really appreciated the push, and it went smoothly to set it up in AWS, though 
I expect that for a beginner with no previous experience of servers, this might 
have been a very steep learning curve.

**10. Getting to a Production-Ready Deployment**
